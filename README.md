# React + Vite + Tailwind

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite. Additionally, I have installed some plugins to speed up the process. This setup gives you everything you need to get up and running quick with a React + Vite + Tailwind application. There are a few other installs that make the project a bit easier to work with and have some added functionality to make the development process even smoother.
